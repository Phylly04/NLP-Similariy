# Model Size: 'en_core_web_sm' is a smaller model compared to 'en_core_web_md'. It is designed to be lightweight and efficient,
# making it suitable for applications with limited resources or where model size is a concern.

# Vocabulary and Accuracy: Due to its smaller size, 'en_core_web_sm' may have a smaller vocabulary and might 
#not perform as accurately as 'en_core_web_md' in certain tasks. It may not capture certain nuances and may have lower precision/recall rates.

# Included Components: 'en_core_web_sm' includes basic linguistic annotations such as part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, and named entity recognition. 
#However, it lacks certain components present in 'en_core_web_md', such as word vectors (word similarity), entity linking, and 
#larger pretrained word embeddings.
